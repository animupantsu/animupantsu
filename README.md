### Animu Pantsu Archive
**Description:**

Animu Pantsu was a discord server that was founded in August of 2019 by "Thea#0069" and "just cheese#0192" this server existed from August 2019 - Febuary 2020. it was made after an influx of new members coming in softwilly's server that caused many og members to try to branch off and start their own servers. there is another server that was made after animu pantsu's deletion called "animu reborn" but it's nearly dead now and just exists as an reminder of what once was. I was a 16 year old kid back then and i didn't really know how to run a server and that's one of the reasons the server went downhill. also the fact that the members got into alot of drama with other big servers like softwillys and even got myself banned there by posting the server link after it was blacklisted and therefor against the rules. this is an archive of all that's left of the original server.
